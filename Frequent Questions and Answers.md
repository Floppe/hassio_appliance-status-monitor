# Q&A - Things you may want to know

### `#general`

* **<ins>Is this able to survive reloading automations and Home Assistant?</ins>** â€”  Yes! <s>Although, in some super-duper rare cases it might get stuck in the current state. It never happens when the appliance is running, but it might when the job cycle finishes exactly when HA is rebooting.</s> 
This is no longer happening since V2.1.0.

* **<ins>Why is this thing so big? That monstrosity doesn't even show correctly on my small screen!</ins>** â€”  I know ðŸ˜…. There are many conditions, and those increase the visual width of the blueprint in the UI. On mobile devices, it's going to be a pain, but what's important here is that things work and that all the possible situations are handled.

* **<ins>How is this different when compared to [Notify or do something when an appliance like a dishwasher or washing machine finishes](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/notify-or-do-something-when-an-appliance-like-a-dishwasher-or-washing-machine-finishes/254841)?</ins>** â€”  It's very very different and much more articulated. [Read here for more info](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/notify-or-do-something-when-an-appliance-like-a-dishwasher-or-washing-machine-finishes/254841/131?u=leofabri).

* **<ins>Will this slowdown Home Assistant?</ins>** â€” I don't think so. The blueprint will run every time a new power read is polled by HA. If there's no state change, the automation is basically not doing anything and completes super quickly.

* **<ins>How do I update to a new version?</ins>** â€”  Please follow the steps **[here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/detect-and-monitor-the-status-of-an-appliance-based-on-its-power-consumption-v2-0-0-updated/421670/3)**.

### `#overloads`
* **<ins>What is an overload situation? When does it happen?</ins>** â€”  An overload occurs when the appliance is drawing too much power and this affects the entire home grid. This usually triggers your circuit breaker.

* **<ins>Is this blueprint a solution to my overloads?</ins>** â€”  Nope. It just stores the states of your appliance, it doesn't diagnose anything, it notes that it happened. 
**[HA_PowerControl](https://github.com/andbad/HA_PowerControl)** is instead a separate package that takes care of detaching the loads progressively based on a settable priority. It does work, but the appliance is not self-conscious of being the cause of an overload. The `detached_overload` state adds that consciousness. 

* **<ins>Do I really need HA_PowerControl?</ins>** â€” No. Iâ€™m allowing the user to bind this blueprint to whatever system they have for handling those situations. 
You might not want to use anything, in that case, leave the "Appliance Suspended entity" empty.

* **<ins>HA_PowerControl is just in Italian :spaghetti:.. is there no other alternative?</ins>** â€”  I was unable to find anything yet. [I asked](https://github.com/andbad/HA_PowerControl/issues/15) the author if I'm allowed to translate it, but it's still too early to talk about a release.

* **<ins>What does this blueprint do during an overload?</ins>** â€” If the "Appliance Suspended entity" was configured, the state machine should transition to the `detached_overload` state.
